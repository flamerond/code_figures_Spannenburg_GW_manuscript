# code_figures_Spannenburg_GW_manuscript
Interactive Jupyter notebook that downloads data from an open access repository (Zenodo) and generates graphs for the manuscript of on-site pilot testing conducted at a water utility in the Netherlands. 

Press the binder button below to open the Jupyter notebook (containing the script to generate the figures) in the interactive Binder environment!

Using Binder, it is not possible to automatically save the generated figures on a local file on your personal computer. Binder runs in a 'remote container' with no access to your local folders. However, you can just ignore the error that the file or directory is not found and run all the code below to see how the code works and how the figures are generated. For automatically downloading the figures to a local folder, the python script needs to be run not in Binder but on the computer (for example in the Anaconda environment). This however requires the Anaconda software to be installed and can be easily done via the Anaconda website: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
